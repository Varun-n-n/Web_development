# WebSocket Chat Application

This is a simple WebSocket-based chat application that allows users to exchange messages in real-time. It consists of a server-side component (implemented in Python) and a client-side component (implemented in HTML, JavaScript, and optional CSS for styling).

## Features

- Real-time messaging: Messages are delivered in real-time to all connected clients.
- Basic styling: A clean and visually appealing chat interface.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the WebSocket chat application on your local machine.
