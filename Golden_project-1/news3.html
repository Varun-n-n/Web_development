    <p>Self-driving cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are rapidly advancing in technology and are poised to become a common sight on city streets in the near future. This transformative development in transportation has the potential to reshape urban mobility and bring about numerous benefits.</p>

    <p>The key features of self-driving cars include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Autonomous Navigation:</strong> Self-driving cars use a combination of sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to navigate and make driving decisions without human intervention.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety Improvements:</strong> Autonomous vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce accidents caused by human error, such as distracted driving and impaired driving.</li>
      <li><strong>Reduced Traffic Congestion:</strong> Self-driving cars can communicate with each other and optimize traffic flow, potentially reducing congestion and travel times.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Autonomous vehicles can provide mobility solutions for individuals with disabilities and those who are unable to drive.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As self-driving car technology continues to advance, it is essential for cities and communities to prepare for their integration into transportation systems. This includes addressing regulatory and safety considerations, infrastructure upgrades, and public awareness campaigns.</p>

    <p>While self-driving cars hold promise for a more efficient and safer transportation future, there are also challenges and questions to address, such as ethical considerations and the impact on jobs in the transportation industry. As technology evolves, the role of self-driving cars in our cities will continue to be a topic of discussion and exploration.</p>
